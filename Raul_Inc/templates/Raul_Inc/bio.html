        <p>Raul Àvila has been the president of Raul Àvila Inc., since founding the
            company in February 2005.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Driven to become a success in New York City, Mr. Àvila left his hometown
            of Bogota, Colombia in 1984.  Captivated by such elaborate set designs
            when attending designer presentations at New York Fashion Week, he soon
            recognized that event production was his calling.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In 1990, Mr. Àvila began his career in events in NYC working as
            assistant to the legendary event planner, Robert Isabell.  He thrived
            during his tenure at Robert Isabell Inc., with a promotion to Creative
            Director in 1998.  After spending
            14 years working by Mr. Isabell’s side, Mr. Àvila was compelled to take
            creative reign and venture out on his own.</p>
        <br>
        <p> With the same tenacity and drive that originally brought him to this
            country, Mr. Àvila saw rapid success upon starting his business.  A solid
            foundation of clients that had the utmost faith in him, among them Anna
            Wintour, Aerin Lauder, Oscar DeLa Renta, Marc Jacobs, Costume Institute
            Gala, CFDA, Cartier, Town &amp; Country, Cond&eacute; Nast were integral
            in establishing him as a fixture in
            the fashion industry.  Known for his impeccable taste and
            talent, he quickly garnered an impressive roster of clients that remain
            faithful to his work today.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Specializing in floral design and sophisticated décor, Mr.
            Àvila produces special events ranging from benefits and weddings to
            fashion shows and photo shoots.  Most notably he has been responsible
            for overseeing the décor design for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s
            Annual Costume Institute Gala since 2007.  Still bestowed this honor at
            present, Mr. Àvila has the unique opportunity to transform the MET into
            an exquisite venue for this important benefit each year.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As his business matures, Mr. Àvila has his sights set on expanding his
            international presence in the events industry as well as introducing his
            own product line.  In addition, Mr. Àvila is evolving his philanthropic
            efforts, becoming more involved with the causes he supports.</p>
